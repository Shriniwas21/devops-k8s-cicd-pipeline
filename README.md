## Phase 1: Jenkins Setup
# This phase includes the setup of a Jenkins CI server on an Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance using a t2.micro (free tier) machine. Jenkins was configured to run on port 8080. Java 17 (Amazon Corretto) was installed, and Jenkins was provisioned using the official Jenkins repository.
